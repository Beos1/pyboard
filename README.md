## Making the game agrovation in python
A game that has been played in my family for as long as I can remember.
Basic rules for the game are moving all of your marbles/units from the home(start) to the base(finish) with some restrictions on how you can move

### Rules
On each turn roll a single dice and can move any marble of your choice that number of spaces, if you roll a 6 you get to roll again.  In order to leave your "Home" you need to roll a 6 or a 1.
